## Inspiration
#Gimkit, Blooket, Kahoot, etc.
I was inspired by other learning game solutions and wanted to build upon that idea.
## What it does
Brain Battle is a fun multiplayer mobile game to learn new topics. Two teams answer questions to unlock weapons and deal damage to the other team. The team with the most damage wins.
#Learn curated or publicly created topics.
Brain Battle will have topics about different subjects such as Language Arts, Math, Science, Spanish, etc. that are curated to help you learn/practice them. Users can also create and publish their own specific question sets for different topics.
#Friends
You will be able to add friends see topics that they’re learning and join servers that they are playing in.
#Save Progress
You can see the number of games you have won on the top left near the Diamond icon. You will also be able to see your stats of the most missed and most confident questions by logging in and clicking the account image on the top right.
#Intuitive Game Design
Use the virtual joystick to move and the attack button to fight opponents by approaching them. Answer questions with the question button and earn/lose points. Spend points on weapon upgrades at the store. Menus make you invincible but close after 30 seconds. You can see your stats and the team’s stats on the top of the screen and your health on the left.
#Easy to use interface
Brain Battle has an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use interface, making learning more accessible to everyone.

## How we built it
This is currently a concept for a mobile app that I designed using Figma (a user interface design platform). It would be nice if I could have made this into a real application, but this is my first Hackathon, it was too complicated, and I only had 2 days to make it due to my weekday schedule. I made this myself without a team.

## What's next for Brain Battle
Creating a somewhat functioning version of this concept would be next.
